## RuboCop LightTable Plugin

[RuboCop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop/), Ruby syntax and style checker, integration for LightTable.

Marks lines that violate configured cops and shows violations on gutter hover.

## Requirements

Requires the RuboCop gem to be installed and the `rubocop`
executable to be available on the path.

Tested with rbenv but should be fine with other Ruby managers. If not,
let me know via an issue.
